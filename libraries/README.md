# Connect IQ Libraries
This is a collection of general tools and utilities that can be plugged into a Connect IQ app. Each library contains a README which outlines what all it can do and how you can use it in your project.

For an overview of what you can build check out [this page](http://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/what-you-can-build/) on the [Garmin Developer website](http://developer.garmin.com/).
